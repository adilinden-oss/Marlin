# Creality Ender-3 Configurations

These are the Creality Ender-3 configurations from the official [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository. I use these as basis for my Creality Ender-3 printer. As such, the configurations will reflect the particular board I am using at any point in time.
